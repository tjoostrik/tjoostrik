Hi, I’m @tjoostrik.
I’m interested in automation and communication with diverent devices.
In school i learned to program with Java, mySQL and Function blocks (PLC programming).
In my intership at Phoenix Contact i learnt (and still learning) to make programms with C++.
Also i have some knowledge of MQTT, Docker, Cmake and zeroMQ.
I’m currently learning zeroMQ and PLCnext.
Currently i have an intership at Phoenix Contact to let two PLCnext controllers (A PLC controller based on linux) connect with eachother using zeroMQ.
This internship is for my 4th year as MBO Smart Industry and is 20 weeks long.
In my 2th year i also had a intership at Phoenix Contact.
In this intership i made a cross-compilation for a telegram bot zo de PLCnext controller could connect with telegram and respond on messages.
The PLCnext also run programs when you send a certain message to the bot.
